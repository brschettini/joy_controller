# joy_controller - Publishing a custom ROS message using a joystick

This program is used to send a custom message using a joystick. For instance this program only works for a XBox 360 controller. If you want to use another controller, please visit [this page](http://wiki.ros.org/joystick_remapper).

The launch file [joy_cont.launch](https://github.com/brschettini/joy_controller/blob/master/launch/joy_cont.launch) starts three ROS nodes, as you can see typing `rqt_graph` in your command line.
